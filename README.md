### About me
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics at Emory University. Before my academic pursuits, I gained valuable industry experience as a Research Analyst at Yanolja, where I focused on designing experiments and applying causal inference techniques. I used A/B testing and statistical modeling to uncover actionable insights. My prior research experience in Behavioral Science for over two years further enhanced my skills in experimental design and the nuanced interpretation of online experiments. 

Combining my industry and research experience, I have cultivated a unique perspective that allows me to apply analytical techniques effectively while considering the complexities of consumer behavior. I am excited to continue utilizing my expertise to solve complex business challenges by leveraging statistics and data science.
